This program allows the user to explorer the mandelbrot, julia, and tricorn sets. 

Controls for the program:

    1. Arrow key up: Increases the number of iterations of that the escape time algorithm uses. The
       result of this change is that the algorithm is able to give more resolution to the set.
    
    2. Arrow key down: Decreases the number of iterations that the esapape time algorithm uses. The 
       result of this change is that the resolution of the set decreases.
    
    3. Arrow key Left: Switches to the next fractal.

    4. Arrow key rigHT: Switches to the previous fractal.

    5. Q: Increases the angle of the julia set.

    6. S: Decreases the angle of the julia set.

    7. W: Increases the radius of the julia set.

    8. S: Decreases the radius of the julia set.

    9. E: Increases the bail out radius.

    10. D: Decreases the bail out radius. Creates interesting effect when it is set to one.

    11. R: Resets all parameters for rendering fractals. However, it does stay on the same 
        fractal that is currently being rendered.

    12. F: Resets the zoom.

    13. P: Pauses and unpauses mouse based zooming on the mandelbrot set and animation of
        the julia set.

There is also mouse based manual zooming. To achieve this, simply click, drag, and
release around an area you want to see.

NOTE: I have included a screenshots folder which contains intersting images that were created as
I zoomed into the various sets.
